            <h2>Deadpool and Wolverine reviews</h2>
            <div class="review-box">
                <p><strong>looneymax:</strong> Weak story but a fun ride.</p>
                <p><strong>omar-d-sheikh:</strong> Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. What a fun movie. I like the dialogue and clever quips with f bombs sprinkled in. It's definitely not taking itself too seriously. There is tons of fun cameos I didn't expect! I normally watch spoiler videos ahead of time, but I didn't on this occasion and I'm glad I didn't because there was some oh snap moments! It's a very good action packed fun film. The breaking the Fox jokes and speaking to the camera jokes are too funny. I can definitely see more sequels for these two on the horizon. They are promoting this movie hard I just watched these two on Hot Ones eating chicken wings They make a dynamic duo. Until your 90 Wolverine ...until your 90 lol.</p>
                <p><strong>christopherosenbauer:</strong>I must be the only person who didn't like it</p>
                <p><strong>jagandphil:</strong>The best watch in years. I read an IGN review where the guy gave it a 7 because the story was poor.The guy really needs to read the room.You do not go to see Deadpool for a great, in-depth story which will make you think.You go to see Deadpool for fun, for obscene fight scenes, great jokes, bad jokes...</p>

         <h2>Interstellar reviews</h2>
            <div class="review-box">
                <p><strong>Ksa-2010:</strong> I waited 5 years to watch it again. After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE</p>
                <p><strong>kosmasp:</strong> A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.</p>
                <p><strong>e-jackson1985:</strong> Masterpiece.
                    Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's.
                    But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing.</p>
                <p><strong>Patterson13:</strong>Best movie I have seen in my life.</p>
